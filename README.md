# BetterDCPrevent

### I didn't like that the mainstream DC Prevent shipped with an extra DLL, also it lacked features.

## Features
- Customisable left & right mouse debounce limits
- Copyable logs
- Logs click time
- Logs current debounce on click
- Hide to tray button so it doesn't clog your taskbar
- Fully open source

## Building
- Clone from source
- Build it

*You might have have some problems with the icon, but I don't know why. The icon is there, figure it out if you really need the icon that badly.*
