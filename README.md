# BetterDCPrevent

BetterDCPrevent is an improved alternative to the mainstream DC Prevent. It removes the need for an extra DLL, adds new features, and is fully open source.

## 📩 To-do
- **Revamp UI:** Use `C++/WinRT` and redo the UI to support light/dark themes, and look more like a native windows application. 
     
## ✨ Features
- **Customizable Mouse Debounce:** Set individual debounce limits for left and right mouse buttons.
- **Link Debounce Limits:** Option to link the left and right debounce limits for synchronized settings.
- **Lock Debounce Settings:** Lock your debounce settings until the app is restarted, perfect for scrims.
- **Persistent Configuration:** Your settings are saved and retained across restarts.
- **Detailed Logging:**
  - Logs opening times to ensure maximum trust.
  - Logs click times.
  - Easily copy logs for analysis.
- **Auto Update Checking:** Automatically checks for updates to keep your app up-to-date.
- **System Tray Support:** Minimize the app to the system tray to keep your taskbar clutter-free.
- **Fully Open Source:** Explore the source code as much as you want to ensure it's malware-free.
